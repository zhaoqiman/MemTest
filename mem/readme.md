# RAM Test with /dev/mem

This project implements RAM test algorithms using `/dev/mem`.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to test the functionality and reliability of RAM using various test algorithms, such as March C. The code interacts with the `/dev/mem` device file to access the physical memory directly.


## Algorithms

This project currently supports the following RAM test algorithms:

- March C
- ...
